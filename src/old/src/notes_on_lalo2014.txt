Gives evidence for
1. a functional calcium-dependent vesicular release mechanism for gliotransmitter release
2. P2X-mediated ionic currents in neocortical neurons from ATP released by astrocytes
3. preventing release or deleting/blocking P2X-receptors impairs purinergic modulation of GABAergic synaptic transmission
Results
Uncaging calcium in the astrocyte elicited P2X-mediated unitary events (4 Hz) in the HEK cells expressing P2X2 receptors. 
Some sniffer cells also responded with unitary currents (0.2 Hz) without evoked calcium transients in astrocytes.
activating astrocyte specific PAR-1 receptors (TFLLR) that activate ip3-receptors or NMDA receptors lead to robust increase in the P2X2-mediated currents.
Amplitude: 11.2 pA
Risetime: 1.6 ms
Decaytime: 15 ms
Pretreatment with a blocker of vacuolar-type H-ATPase bafilomycin A1 decreased both amplitude and frequency of calcium triggered P2X2-mediated events.
Also, astrocytes from dn-SNARE mice showed reduced release after elevation of astrocytic calcium levels
Very important: Figure 2D
-------------------------
Release probability: 0.28
Quantal size: 7.9 pA
Other experiments ruled out the involvement of non-vesicular release of ATP via TREK-1 potassium channels and best1 chloride channels
Thus astrocytes release ATP via a calcium-dependent exocytosis mechanism (SNARE).

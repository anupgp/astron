Results
Blocking P2Y-receptor (using RB-2) increased the amplitude of EPSCs but not IPSCs (actually decreased the amplitude and this probably a non-specific effect)
Blocking P2X-receptor (using PPADS) or A1-receptor (DPCPX) had not effect no neither EPSCs or IPSCs
Blocking P2Y-receptor increased synaptic fatigue induced by a train of 10 pulses (10 Hz)
Blocking ATP degradation decreased both EPSC and IPSC amplitude. This effect could be blocked by a P2Y-receptor antagonist. This effect was not present when glutamate/GABA was externally applied.
Direct ATP(2 micro M) significantly reduced both EPSC and IPSCs. This effect was abolished by both P2Y and A1-receptor antagonists but not by P2X-receptor and A2-receptor antagonists (DMPX).
Direct perfusion of adenosine (10 micro M) also suppressed EPSCs but not IPSCs. This suppression could be blocked by A1-receptor antagonist but not by P2Y-receptor antagonist.
ATP does not modify synaptic currents induced by local application of glutamate or GABA.
ATP (10 micro M) significantly decreased the frequency (not amplitude) of mEPSCs & mIPSCs.
ATP (10 micro M) also increased PPF
ATP (10 micro M) decreased somatic calcium current in a reversible manner.

Heterosynaptic synaptic depression of EPSCs/IPSCs only when the stimulated neuron (one which fires high frequency action potentials, 10 pulses at 10 Hz) is glutamatergic
Efficiency of suppression is time-dependent: maximum suppression at about 500 ms, moderate at 200 ms, no suppression at 1 s after the high frequency stimulation.
The Hetero-LTD is blocked by P2Y-receptor antagonists but not by A1 or P2X antagonists

Is ATP coreleased with glutamate? Is ATP released after activation of glutamate receptors?
Blocking AMPA receptors, not NMDA receptors, prevented ATP-mediated synaptic suppression.
Blocking H-LTD by P2Y and/or AMPA receptor antagonists were not additive. Suggesting a sequential, rather than parallel, activation.
How is ATP released? Astrocytes?
Blocking gap junctions abolished high frequency-mediated H-LTD but not direct ATP-mediated suppression
